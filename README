INSTALLATION

Refer to the installation instructions in doc/reference/manual.pdf. Otherwise read on:

You need Java 1.6 JRE to run the Genyris interpreter. Check with your JRE
version with:

  $ java -version

Set your GENYRIS_HOME environment variable to the root folder where you unpacked
the release. Add $GENYRIS_HOME/bin to your path. 
Make the file $GENYRIS_HOME/bin/genyris executable.

Start the command-line interpreter with Java:

  $ genyris

You will see a welcome message followed by a prompt:

  *** Welcome birchb, Genyris version NNN-xxxxxxxxxxxx.bb is listening...

  > 

Commands can now be typed, use two carriage returns
to terminate each statement.

To test the installation run the self test suite with the following command:

> sys:self-test

All being well, it will print ``OK'' and the number of tests passed.

Examples of Genyris code are in the examples
folder and can be loaded as follows:

     > include "examples/queens.g"

     > run-queens 8
