You need Java 1.6 JRE to run the Genyris interpreter. Check with your JRE
version with:

Set your GENYRIS_HOME environment variable to the root folder where you unpacked
the release. Add $GENYRIS_HOME/bin to your path.

Start the command-line interpreter with Java:

You will see a message followed by a prompt:

  *** Genyris is listening...

Commands can be typed in, use two carriage returns
to terminate an indented statement.

To test the installation run the self test suite with the following command:

All being well, it will print ``OK'' and the number of tests passed.
